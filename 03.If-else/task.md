# If-Else Conditional Challenge

In this challenge, we test your knowledge of using if-else conditional statements to automate decision-making processes. An if-else statement has the following logical flow:

## Task
Given an integer, perform the following conditional actions:

- If the number is **odd**, print `Weird`.
- If the number is **even** and in the inclusive range of **2 to 5**, print `Not Weird`.
- If the number is **even** and in the inclusive range of **6 to 20**, print `Weird`.
- If the number is **even** and **greater than 20**, print `Not Weird`.

Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not the number is weird.

## Input Format
A single line containing a positive integer, *n*.

## Constraints
- The number is a positive integer.

## Output Format
Print `Weird` if the number is weird; otherwise, print `Not Weird`.

### Sample Input 0
```
3
```
### Sample Output 0
```
Weird
```

### Sample Input 1
```
24
```
### Sample Output 1
```
Not Weird
```

## Explanation

### Sample Case 0:
- The number `3` is **odd**, and odd numbers are considered weird.
- Output: `Weird`.

### Sample Case 1:
- The number `24` is **even** and **greater than 20**, so it is **not weird**.
- Output: `Not Weird`.
